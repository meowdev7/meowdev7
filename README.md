## About Me
I'm a passionate Discord bot developer and creator of CreatorDJS, a Node.js package designed to simplify the process of building Discord bots using Discord.js v14.

## CreatorDJS
CreatorDJS is a versatile Node.js package that streamlines the creation of Discord bots. It provides easy-to-use methods for setting up and managing bot functionality, including slash commands, prefix commands, and database connections.

### Features
- **Initialization:** Easily initialize your bot with `creatordjs.init(token, prefix)`.
- **Slash Commands:** Register slash commands with `creatordjs.slash(commands)`.
- **Prefix Commands:** Register prefix commands with `creatordjs.message(commands)`.
- **Database Connectivity:** Connect your bot to MongoDB using Mongoose via `creatordjs.database(mongooseUrl)`.
- **Developer Restrictions:** Secure your bot by restricting certain commands to designated developers.
- **Permission Checks:** Ensure user and bot permissions before executing commands.
- **Dynamic Command Loading:** Load commands dynamically from a specified directory.
- **Event Handling:** Seamlessly handle Discord events with event listeners.
- **Error Handling:** Integrated error handling with an `errorHandler` function.

### Prebuilt Commands
- **Slash Commands:** Includes a variety of prebuilt slash commands like `ping`.
- **Message (Prefix) Commands:** Prebuilt message commands like `ping`.
